# Bounce
The SAT and Ray Casting implementation

The program is based only on the *OpenGL* and *GLUT* libraries.

Functionality:
- The *Separating Axis Theorem [SAT]* algorithm for polygons and circles [not for fast moving objects]
- The *ray casting* algorithm for polygons and circles
- Left options are controlled throughout the key *1*
- To move an object on the arena the mouse coursor has to be inside the object and throughout the left button you can change the position
